**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Simulation setup (provide minimal working example)
   - Fluid properties (density, viscosity, elastic modulus, relaxation time)
   - Domain size and boundary conditions
   - Initial conditions
2. Compilation command used
3. Runtime parameters
4. Error message or unexpected behavior

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**System Information:**
 - OS: [e.g. MacOS 12.1]
 - Compiler: [e.g. gcc 9.3.0]
 - Basilisk Version: [commit hash or date of installation]
 - MPI Version: [if using parallel execution]
 - Python Version: [if using post-processing]

**Screenshots/Output**
If applicable, add:
- Screenshots of simulation visualization
- Log files
- Error messages
- Convergence data
- Interface evolution plots

**Additional context**
- Have you modified any of the source files in `src-local/`?
- Are you using any custom boundary conditions?
- What mesh refinement level are you using?
- Any other relevant details about your setup
